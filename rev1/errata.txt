RGB B3 and R3 are swapped at U2
    Fix can by done by rework, at the back of the board near Pi connector.
    Swap two outermost traces, which connect Pi pin right column row 4 with
        right column row 6.
    FIXED IN REV2

PCB is a little wide at slot edge, but has good alignment.
Use photos to reduce for easier fit.
    FIXED IN REV2

Need option to generate correct 7M clock
    FIXED IN REV2, I think

Need option to generate 14M clock?
    Could XOR CDAC and 7M - not implemented

Make front cutout deeper
    FIXED IN REV2

Optimize routing to avoid anything noisy crossing clock lines
    FIXED IN REV2

4.7 Ohm in series with 47 uF cap on each of VC1 and VC3 clocks to GND
    VC1 - 47 uF - 4.7 Ohm - GND
    FIXED IN REV2

Use SN74LS224NSR (Octal buffer) for delay (10ns typical per gate)
    Unfortunately, it's 5V only
    NOT USED in REV2

Use 74LVC241AT20-13 (Octal buffer) for delay (3.5ns typical per gate)
    Not great, but at least it's available at JLC and is 3.5V, 5V tolerant
    FIXED IN REV2

Or another 74LVC86APW (quad XOR) for shorter delay (2.2ns typical per gate)
    NOT USED in REV2

Can switch 3.3K resistor to 1K (tested with Rev 1)
    FIXED IN REV2

Need option to Latch FF OSD at clock edge
    I think this should be CSYNC. Also expose HSYNC and VSYNC?
    Also expose 5V and GND
